# Coding Quiz Challenge

## Purpose
This website tests your knowledge on three coding languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are 8 questions, and you have 60 seconds to complete the quiz. If you get one wrong, an extra 10 seconds is deducted from your remaining time. You can see your top 5 scores, to constantly try to beat your best score. Good luck!
